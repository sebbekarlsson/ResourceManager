Automation[1] or automatic control, is the use of various control systems for
operating equipment such as machinery, processes in factories, boilers and heat
treating ovens, switching on telephone networks, steering and stabilization of
ships, aircraft and other applications with minimal or reduced human
intervention. Some processes have been completely automated.

The biggest benefit of automation is that it saves labor; however, it is also
used to save energy and materials and to improve quality, accuracy and
precision.

The term automation, inspired by the earlier word automatic
(coming from automaton), was not widely used before 1947, when General Motors
established an automation department.[1] It was during this time that industry
was rapidly adopting feedback controllers, which were introduced in the
1930s.[2]

Automation has been achieved by various means including mechanical, hydraulic,
pneumatic, electrical, electronic devices and computers, usually in
combination.
Complicated systems, such as modern factories, airplanes and ships typically
use all these combined techniques.
